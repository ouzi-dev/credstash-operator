## How to contribute to Credstash Operator

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ouzi-dev/credstash-operator/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ouzi-dev/credstash-operator/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* For a more detailed description of what should a bug report contain, have a look at the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

#### **Do you want to add an enhancement?**

* If this is a feature request, have a look at the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
* If you wish to contribute and submit a patch with the enhancement, feel free to go ahead and skip the issue creation. We would still recommend creating a feature request if the enhancement requires significant changes such that we can discuss the changes before any significant time is spent developing them.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or adds a feature ?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. 
  Make sure the title of the PR starts with:
  - `feat: ` if its a major feature,
  - `fix: ` if its a minor one,
  - `doc: ` if its documentation related.
  Include the relevant issue number if applicable.  

* Before submitting, please ensure that golint passes and test cases have been added for the relevant changes.
* Once submitted, a member of the Ouzi team will reach out for the next steps.
